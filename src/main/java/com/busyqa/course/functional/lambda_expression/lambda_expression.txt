Lambda Expressions

Lambda expression helps us to write our code in functional style. It provides a 
clear and concise way to implement SAM interface(Single Abstract Method) by 
using an expression. It is very useful in collection library in which it helps 
to iterate, filter and extract data.

In simple words we use lambda expressions to create anonymous methods.

Why use Lambda Expression
   To provide the implementation of Functional interface.
   Less coding.
   
Java Lambda Expression Syntax

(argument-list) -> {body}  

Java lambda expression is consisted of three components.

1) Argument-list: It can be empty or non-empty as well.
2) Arrow-token: It is used to link arguments-list and body of expression.
3) Body: It contains expressions and statements for lambda expression.

No Parameter Syntax
() -> {  
     //Body of no parameter lambda  
}  

One Parameter Syntax
(p1) -> {  
     //Body of single parameter lambda  
}  

Two Parameter Syntax
(p1,p2) -> {  
     //Body of multiple parameter lambda  
}
