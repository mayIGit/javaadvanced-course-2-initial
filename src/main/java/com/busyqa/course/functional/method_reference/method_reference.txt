Java Method References

Java provides a new feature called method reference in Java 8. Method reference 
is used to refer method of functional interface. It is compact and easy form of 
lambda expression. Each time when you are using lambda expression to just 
referring a method, you can replace your lambda expression with method reference. 

You use lambda expressions to create anonymous methods. Sometimes, however, a 
lambda expression does nothing but call an existing method. In those cases, it's 
often clearer to refer to the existing method by name. Method references enable 
you to do this; they are compact, easy-to-read lambda expressions for methods 
that already have a name.

Types of Method References

There are following types of method references in java:

Reference to a static method.
Reference to an instance method.
Reference to a constructor.
